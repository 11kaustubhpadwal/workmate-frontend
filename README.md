### About

This is a repository for WorkMate web application's frontend code.

WorkMate is a full stack web application made using React.js and Node.js for finding jobs. It uses the open-source Remotive API for fetching jobs.

I have created this application as a part of my final year diploma thesis and I also use it as a portfolio to show my skills in full stack development.
